    abstract  =  {Abstract The progress of science is tied to the standardization of measurements, instruments, and data. This is especially true in the Big Data age, where analyzing large data volumes critically hinges on the data being standardized. Accordingly, the lack of community-sanctioned data standards in paleoclimatology has largely precluded the benefits of Big Data advances in the field. Building upon recent efforts to standardize the format and terminology of paleoclimate data, this article describes the Paleoclimate Community reporTing Standard (PaCTS), a crowdsourced reporting standard for such data. PaCTS captures which information should be included when reporting paleoclimate data, with the goal of maximizing the reuse value of paleoclimate datasets, particularly for synthesis work and comparison to climate model simulations. Initiated by the LinkedEarth project, the process to elicit a reporting standard involved an international workshop in 2016, various forms of digital community engagement over the next few years, and grassroots working groups. Participants in this process identified important properties across paleoclimate archives, in addition to the reporting of uncertainties and chronologies; they also identified archive-specific properties and distinguished reporting standards for new vs. legacy datasets. This work shows that at least 135 respondents overwhelmingly support a drastic increase in the amount of metadata accompanying paleoclimate datasets. Since such goals are at odds with present practices, we discuss a transparent path towards implementing or revising these recommendations in the near future, using both bottom-up and top-down approaches.}

    abstract  =  {Abstract We present a detailed analysis of the seasonal distribution, size, morphological variability, and geochemistry of co-occurring pink and white chromotypes of Globigerinoides ruber from a high-resolution (1â€“2 weeks) and long-running sediment trap time series in the northern Gulf of Mexico. We find no difference in the seasonal flux of the two chromotypes. Although flux of G. ruber is consistently lowest in winter, the flux-weighted signal exported to marine sediments represents mean annual conditions in the surface mixed layer. We observe the same morphological diversity among pink specimens of G. ruber as white. Comparison of the oxygen and carbon isotopic composition ($\delta$18O and $\delta$13C) of two morphotypes (sensu stricto and sensu lato) of pink G. ruber reveals the isotopes to be indistinguishable. The test size distribution within the population varies seasonally, with the abundance of large individuals increasing (decreasing) with increasing (decreasing) sea surface temperature. We find no systematic offsets in the Mg/Ca and $\delta$18O of co-occurring pink and white G. ruber. The sediment trap data set shows that the Mg/Ca-temperature sensitivity for both chromotypes is much lower than the canonical 9\%/Â°C, which can likely be attributed to the secondary influence of both salinity and pH on foraminiferal Mg/Ca. Using paired Mg/Ca and $\delta$18O, we evaluate the performance of a suite of published equations for calculating sea surface temperature, sea surface salinity, and isotopic composition of seawater ($\delta$18Osw), including a new salinity-$\delta$18Osw relationship for the northern Gulf of Mexico from water column observations.},

	abstract  =  {Climate models are foundational to formulations of climate policy and must successfully reproduce key features of the climate system. The temporal spectrum of observed global surface temperature is one such critical benchmark. This spectrum is known to obey scaling laws connecting astronomical forcings, from orbital to annual scales. We provide evidence that the current hierarchy of climate models is capable of reproducing the increase in variance in global-mean temperature at low frequencies. We suggest that successful climate predictions at decadal-to-centennial horizons hinge critically on the accuracy of initial and boundary conditions, particularly for the deep ocean state.Climate records exhibit scaling behavior with large exponents, resulting in larger fluctuations at longer timescales. It is unclear whether climate models are capable of simulating these fluctuations, which draws into question their ability to simulate such variability in the coming decades and centuries. Using the latest simulations and data syntheses, we find agreement for spectra derived from observations and models on timescales ranging from interannual to multimillennial. Our results confirm the existence of a scaling break between orbital and annual peaks, occurring around millennial periodicities. That both simple and comprehensive ocean{\textendash}atmosphere models can reproduce these features suggests that long-range persistence is a consequence of the oceanic integration of both gradual and abrupt climate forcings. This result implies that Holocene low-frequency variability is partly a consequence of the climate system{\textquoteright}s integrated memory of orbital forcing. We conclude that climate models appear to contain the essential physics to correctly simulate the spectral continuum of global-mean temperature; however, regional discrepancies remain unresolved. A critical element of successfully simulating suborbital climate variability involves, we hypothesize, initial conditions of the deep ocean state that are consistent with observations of the recent past.},
